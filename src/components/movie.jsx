        <h4>‘Romancham’ director Jithu Madhavan returns with his sophomore effort, that is held afloat by Fahadh Faasil running riot in one of his most colourful characters</h4>
        <p>The most tense moment in Aavesham is placed not during one of the numerous fights, but bang in the middle of a game of dumb charades. The game takes place in the lair of Rangan (Fahadh Faasil), a colourful gangster, stories about whom range from the chillingly realistic to the far-fetched. One of those stories we have heard earlier about him happens to involve a game of dumb charades, which apparently led to a violent burst of anger.
           
The most tense moment in Aavesham is placed not during one of the numerous fights, but bang in the middle of a game of dumb charades. The game takes place in the lair of Rangan (Fahadh Faasil), a colourful gangster, stories about whom range from the chillingly realistic to the far-fetched. One of those stories we have heard earlier about him happens to involve a game of dumb charades, which apparently led to a violent burst of anger.

It is a cleverly-crafted scene which makes us question our understanding of that character until then, and ends up reassuring us that we made the right assessment after all, only to upset it again spectacularly a while later. This ambiguity about Rangan is one of the things that filmmaker Jithu Madhavan pulls off successfully in the gangster comedy Aavesham, his sophomore effort after the hit horror comedy Romancham.
Aavesham is a different beast altogether with Fahadh running riot as the gangster adorned in bling, and with a habit of sharing his dance reels. We see Rangan through the eyes of three Malayali students — Aju (Hipster), Bibi (J.S.Mithun) and Shanthan (Roshan Shanavas) — in Bengaluru, who are frequenting seedy bars with the intention of gaining some “local support” to take revenge on their seniors who bashed them up.
